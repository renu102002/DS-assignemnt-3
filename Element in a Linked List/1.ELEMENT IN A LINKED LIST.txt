1.ELEMENT IN A LINKED LIST:
Explanation:
•	Iterative Approach:
	The search Iterative function iterates through the linked list using a while loop, comparing each node's data with the target element.
	If the element is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
•	Recursive Approach:
	The search Recursive function recursively calls itself on the next node until the base case (end of the list) is reached.
	If the current node contains the target element, it returns true; otherwise, it returns the result of the recursive call.
Advantages and Disadvantages:
Iterative Approach:
	ADVANTAGES:
•	Typically uses less memory as it doesn't involve the overhead of recursive function calls.
•	May have slightly better performance due to reduced function call overhead.
        Efficiency: Iterative solutions are generally more memory-efficient as they do not involve additional function calls on the call stack.
        Tail Recursion: Iterative solutions can be optimized for tail recursion, making them more memory-efficient in some cases.
	DISADVANTAGES:
•	Code may be more complex and harder to read compared to the recursive approach.
        Code Length: For certain problems, iterative solutions might require more lines of code compared to recursive solutions.
        Readability: In some cases, iterative code may be less readable and more error-prone.
Recursive Approach:
	ADVANTAGES:
•	Often more concise and easier to understand, especially for simple algorithms.
•	Matches the natural recursive structure of linked lists.
        Elegance: Recursive solutions can be more elegant and concise, especially for simpler problems, enhancing code readability.
        Simplifies Complex Problems: For complex problems, recursion might simplify the code by breaking it into smaller, more manageable pieces.
	DISADVANTAGES:
•	Can consume more memory due to the recursive call stack.
•	May have slightly lower performance due to the overhead of function calls.
        Feel free to test and run this program in Visual Studio 2022 to observe the search results using both iterative and recursive approaches.
        Space Overhead: Recursive solutions consume additional space on the call stack, which can lead to a stack overflow for large input sizes.
        Performance Overhead: Recursive solutions may have a performance overhead due to function calls.
